\sloppy
Kenya consists of $47$ counties with semi-autonomous county governments  \cite{Barasa2017}. As a result of the high degree of county-level autonomy, the policies and regulations often differ across the counties, hence the effects of weather on crop yield are likely to be different across the counties. Therefore, following the standard methodology, we estimated a battery of linear mixed effects models (also known as mixed models) commonly used to analyse longitudinal data \cite{bates2000mixed}. Mixed models are suitable for analysis of panel data as they account for the panel structure of the dataset. These types of models include both fixed effects parameters and random effects. Fixed effects are analogous to parameters in a classical linear regression model and value of each effect is assumed to be fixed over all counties \cite{bates2010lme4}. On the other hand, random effects are unobserved random variables. There are at least three benefits of treating a set of parameters as a random sample from some distribution. \textit{(i)} Extrapolation of inference to a wider population \textit{(ii)} improved accounting for system uncertainty and \textit{(iii)} efficiency of estimation %(\citealp{KERYch9, KERYch12}).

Formally, a linear mixed model can be described by the distribution of two vectors of random variables: the response $\mathscr{Y}$ and the vector of random effects $\mathscr{B}$. The distribution of $\mathscr{B}$ is multivariate normal and the conditional distribution of $\mathscr{Y}$ given $\mathscr{B}=\mathbf{b}$ is multivariate normal of a form %(\citealp{bates2010lme4, KERYch9}):




\begin{equation}\label{MixedGeneral}
\begin{array}{lcl}

(\mathscr{Y}|\mathscr{B}=\mathbf{b})& \sim & \mathit{N}(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{b},\sigma^2\mathbf{I}),

\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \times p$ model matrix of fixed effects, $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a $p$-dimensional fixed-effects parameter, $\mathbf{Z}$ is an $n \times q$ model matrix for the $q$-dimensional vector of random-effects variable $\mathscr{B}$ evaluated at $\mathbf{b}$ and $\sigma$ a scale factor. The distribution of $\mathscr{B}$ can be written as: 

\begin{equation}\label{ranefDist}
\mathscr{B} \sim \mathit{N}(0,\mathbf{\Sigma}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a $q \times q$ positive semi-definite variance-covariance matrix.

\item Verbal description and interpretation of the results. Discussing goodness of fit using various criteria such as AIC or alternatives to $R^2$.
%\item Possibly estimate simple regressions with the same explanatory variables as the preferred mixed effects specification. This would give us an approximation of $R^2$ which could be used to compare our models.

	%	\begin{itemize}%
		%	\item \textcolor{red}{Annemie has advised me that for a more precise approximation of $R^2$ we can estimate a simple regression of yields on the random intercepts (county level dummy variables) and then subtract the $R^2$ of this model from the $R^2$ of the simple regression with the explanatory variables of the preferred mixed models (the model described in the bullet point above). This would give us a percentage of yield variability explained by the weather measures not including the variability explained by the random intercepts.}
