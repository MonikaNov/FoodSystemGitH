\subsection{Data}\label{Data}

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between maize yields and climate. Our dataset consists of an yearly panel of $47$ counties of Kenya describing the period of $1981-2017$. 
	We acquired the county level yearly yield data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Regarding the weather data, we exploited $0.25^\circ$ resolution precipitation and temperature gridded datasets. The precipitation data were obtained from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) while the temperature data are available at the website of the Berkeley Earth. We calculated spatial averages of the gridded data over the counties to get a single value for each county and each point in time. The frequency of precipitation and temperature data was daily, therefore, further aggregation was needed to obtain yearly values corresponding to the yearly frequency of the yield data. Hence, each weather characteristic was further aggregated over years resulting in a county-level panel conformable with the yield data. 
	
	There are two predominant rainfall regimes in Kenya. The arid and semi-arid (ASAL) counties exhibit mostly bi-modal precipitation patterns with long rains lasting from March to May and short rains occurring between October and December. In the non-ASAL counties, the single rainy season usually starts in March and lasts until August. Following the precipitation patterns and closely related planting and harvesting calendar, we computed yearly values of various weather characteristics as follows: For the ASAL counties, we used daily data covering October, November and December of the previous year and March, April, May of the current year and for the non-ASAL counties we used daily data covering March to August of the current year.


Following the procedure described above, we calculated a number of previously used characteristics of precipitation and temperature including indicators of floods (for the list of these measures see table~\ref{vars} in the appendix). The measures which we found significant were: Total seasonal precipitation and its squared values, average seasonal temperature, coefficient of variation of seasonal precipitation, coefficient of variation of average seasonal temperature (converted into Kelvin because other scales of temperature such us Celsius are interval and coefficient of variation does not have any meaning for data measured on an interval scale),  maximum length of dry spell in number of days and the number of dry spells lasting for four days or more (we considered every day when precipitation didn't exceed $1$ mm as a dry day). We did not include squared values of the average seasonal temperature as it was not significant in our models and there is not much evidence of non-linear relationship between yield and temperature in the past literature.

Kenya consists of $47$ counties with semi-autonomous county governments. As a result of the high degree of county-level autonomy, the policies and regulations often differ across the counties, hence the effects of weather on crop yield are likely to be different across the counties. Therefore, following the standard methodology, we estimated a battery of linear mixed effects models (also known as mixed models) commonly used to analyse longitudinal data \cite{bates2000mixed}. Mixed models are suitable for analysis of panel data as they account for the panel structure of the dataset. These types of models include both fixed effects parameters and random effects. Fixed effects are analogous to parameters in a classical linear regression model and value of each effect is assumed to be fixed over all counties \cite{bates2010lme4}. On the other hand, random effects are unobserved random variables. There are at least three benefits of treating a set of parameters as a random sample from some distribution. \textit{(i)} Extrapolation of inference to a wider population \textit{(ii)} improved accounting for system uncertainty and \textit{(iii)} efficiency of estimation \cite{KERYch9,KERYch12}.

Formally, a linear mixed model can be described by the distribution of two vectors of random variables: the response $\mathscr{Y}$ and the vector of random effects $\mathscr{B}$. The distribution of $\mathscr{B}$ is multivariate normal and the conditional distribution of $\mathscr{Y}$ given $\mathscr{B}=\mathbf{b}$ is multivariate normal of a form %(\citealp{bates2010lme4, KERYch9}):




\begin{equation}\label{MixedGeneral}
\begin{array}{lcl}

(\mathscr{Y}|\mathscr{B}=\mathbf{b})& \sim & \mathit{N}(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{b},\sigma^2\mathbf{I}),

\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \times p$ model matrix of fixed effects, $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a $p$-dimensional fixed-effects parameter, $\mathbf{Z}$ is an $n \times q$ model matrix for the $q$-dimensional vector of random-effects variable $\mathscr{B}$ evaluated at $\mathbf{b}$ and $\sigma$ a scale factor. The distribution of $\mathscr{B}$ can be written as: 

\begin{equation}\label{ranefDist}
\mathscr{B} \sim \mathit{N}(0,\mathbf{\Sigma}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a $q \times q$ positive semi-definite variance-covariance matrix.





It was apparent from the histogram of the maize yield data that the distribution of maize yield was closer to a log-normal than to a normal distribution. Therefore, we opted for a log-linear functional form of our models as is a common practice in agricultural economics. Furthermore, we scaled all predictors by subtracting mean and dividing them by standard deviation to avoid convergence problems.


To find the most suitable set of fixed effects, we adapted a stepwise selection procedure which minimized the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The first step of the procedure was the estimation of the model with the complete set of our weather measures in the fixed effects and with the random intercepts. After this, we performed a search through the subsets of the fixed effects minimizing the AIC and allowing for steps in both `backward' and `forward' directions (that is removing and adding predictors). We decided not to include number of heatwave days and average maximum daily temperature although including them as fixed effects would slightly improve the AIC. The reasons for not including them were their strong correlation with average seasonal temperature (the correlation coefficient was $0.981$ in case of maximum daily temperature and $0.517$ for the number of heatwave days with the p-values smaller than $1\times10^{-6}$ in both cases), high variance inflation factor (VIF) of the maximum temperature ($5.397$) and the lack of significance of their individual t-tests (the p-values were $0.121$ for the maximum daily temperature and $0.075$ for the number of heatwave days). Furthermore, including the heatwave days and maximum daily temperature would only lead to small change in AIC from $2080.877$ to $2076.439$ (these values differ from the AIC presented in table~\ref{ARMA} in the appendix because the final estimates reported in table~\ref{ARMA} were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) whereas the models were re-estimated using the ML method for comparison\footnote{In general, REML is the preferred estimation method for the mixed effects models as the ML estimates of the variance component are biased, however, REML criterion is not meaningful for comparison of the models with different fixed effects. Therefore, the models had to be re-estimated by ML for comparison \cite{Zuur2009}.}). In addition, the coefficients of both heatwave days and maximum daily temperature were positive, which is opposite to what we expected. Hence, we concluded that the decrease in AIC and the positive signs are likely to be results of the correlation with average temperature and we did not include them in our preferred model.

We further applied a series of likelihood ratio tests to test for significance of random slopes. No subset of the random slopes improved the fit, therefore besides the fixed effects, our final model only included the random intercepts.\footnote{Although adding the random slope of the coefficient of variation slightly improved the AIC from $2122.226$ to $2122.110$, we decided to not to include the coefficient of variation of temperature in the random effects. The reason for not including the random slope is that the difference in AIC is negligible and the F-test of the comparison of the two models is insignificant favouring the simpler model (p-value$=0.128$).} 

To verify our results, we adapted an alternative step-down model building
approach using the Satterthwaite’s method to determine the p-values of the individual
t-tests \cite{lmerTest}. We started with a model which included the complete set of our weather measures in both fixed effects and random effects. In the first part of the procedure, the insignificant random effects were removed one by one. In each iteration, the insignificant variable with the highest p-value was removed . This was repeated until only the significant predictors remained. After this, we applied an analogous procedure to the fixed effects until we were left only with the significant ones. As recommended in literature, we considered the level of significance $\alpha=0.1$ for random effects and $\alpha=0.05$~ for fixed effects \cite{lmerTest}. This method led to the same model as the one obtained with our primary AIC-based method described above.


According to the conditional Lagrange multiplier (LM) test developed by Baltagi \& Li (1991) and Baltagi \& Li (1995), the errors exhibited a within group autcorrelation structure in our models (the p-value of the LM test was $1.1\times10^{-13}$). To further investigate the autocorrelation structure of the errors, we estimated a number of models (with the subset of predictors chosen as described above) with an ARMA($p$,$q$) error structure. In particular, we estimated all variants of our model with ARMA($p$,$q$) errors such that $p\leq2$ and $q\leq2$. Comparing the AIC criteria and using the corresponding likelihood ratio statistics, we found that the most appropriate error correlation structure was ARMA($1$,$1$). The value of the AIC criterion of the model with the ARMA($1$,$1$) error structure was $2122.2$ while the AIC was $2129.2$ for the model with ARMA($1$,$0$) errors.  The p-value of the likelihood ratio test of the comparison of the model with ARMA($1$,$1$) errors and the model with ARMA($1$,$0$) errors was smaller than $0.003$, hence the ARMA($1$,$1$) error structure turned out to be a better fit. The AIC criteria and the likelihood ratio tests of all the models with ARMA($p$,$q$) errors are summarised in table~\ref{ARMA} in the appendix.

	\section{Results}\label{Results}
	
Besides our main model, we estimated the same specification for two additional subsamples of Kenyan counties. In particular, we estimated the model for the subsample of ASAL counties and for the subsample of non-ASAL counties separately to compare the effects of various weather characteristics across the two areas with significantly different climate. The estimates of all three models are summarised in table~\ref{MainEst}. The first two columns represent the model for all counties, the third and fourth columns include estimates for the subsample of ASAL counties and the last two columns describe the estimates based on the subsample of non-ASAL counties. All predictors were standardised, therefore the estimates and the corresponding p-values can be interpreted as measures of relative importance. 

As an additional measure of relative importance we included F-values of the type \textit{III} analysis of variance (ANOVA) in table~\ref{MainEst}. The F-tests were conducted using the marginal rather than sequential sum of squares. That is, for each variable, the F-test is a test of significance of that part of explained sum of squares which can be contributed to the particular explanatory variable. In other worlds, the F-value is a test statistic of comparison of the preferred model (with all the variables in table~\ref{MainEst}) and the model without the explanatory variable in question but including all other predictors. The type~\textit{III} ANOVA does not depend on the order in which the effects are entered in the model.

The preferred specification has a log-linear functional form, therefore the estimates in table~\ref{MainEst} are not directly interpretable as marginal effects and the effects on yield are multiplicative. The exponents of the estimates (which can be interpreted as additive marginal effects on yield) can be found in table~\ref{KenARe11_exponents} in the appendix.


First, we will focus on the estimates based on the sample of all counties, that is the first two columns in table~\ref{MainEst}. Consistently with our assumptions, seasonal precipitation has mostly positive and significant effect on maize yield while average temperature has negative effects on yields.

  \item[a] Likelihood ratio test of a comparison of the model in each row against the ARMA(${1}$,${1}$) error structure model. ARMA(${1}$,${1}$) error structure seems to be the most suitable as all lower-order correlation structure models are rejected against ARMA(${1}$,${1}$) while ARMA(${1}$,${1}$) is not rejected against any of the higher order structures.

\caption{Predicted multiplicative marginal effects of coefficient of variation (CV) of precipitation (left column) and CV of temperature (right column) on maize yields. The first row (a, b) represents the model for all counties, the second row (c, d) is based on the subsample of arid and semi-arid counties (ASAL) and the third row (e, f) represents the model for the non-ASAL counties. CV of precipitation and temperature (x-axis) are in multiples of their standard deviations. The effects are multiplicative as the models are in log-linear form.}
